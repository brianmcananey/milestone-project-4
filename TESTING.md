# Testing <!-- omit in toc -->


## Automated vs Manual Testing

Automated testing and manual testing, when used in combination, are able to achieve a greater level of testing coverage. Automated testing is good for repetitive and critical tasks, while manual testing is good for new or changing requirements and exploratory testing.

## Manual Testing

</div>

Manual testing allows the tester to explore the site and using experience and creativity to find any issues within the site. It also takes into account flexibility and context, manual testing paramaters can be changed quickly depending on the requirements. The tester can also take into account the prospective users and their knowledge of the system in order to execute tests that are relevant.

## Automated Testing

</div>

Automated tests are repeatable and reliable as there is limited risk for human error. It allows for testing on both a small and a large scale in a quick and efficient manner. Automated testing might be used to test the performance of a site in order to ensure that it can handle page loading.

# Responsiveness

Responsivity tests were carried out using Google Chrome DevTools. Device screen sizes covered include:

- iPhone SE
- iPhone 12 Pro
- Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra
- iPad Air
- Surface Pro 7
- Surface Duo
- Samsung Galaxy A51/71

I also personally tested the website on Samsung Galaxy S22, Samsung Chrome book, Dell XPS 15 laptop and a Dell widescreen monitor.

### Lighthouse <!-- omit in toc -->

| Page | Test Results | Lighthouse Suggested Improvements |
|:---:|---|---|
|Index|![Index Lighthouse testing](static/images/hompage-lighthouse.png)|Specifying a specific width and height of my title image, I wanted to retain as much responsivity as I could and opted to use bootstrap instead.|
|About Page|![About Page Lighthouse testing](static/images/aboutpage-lighthouse.png)|Properly sizing the images would reduce load time and cellular data, currently some images are oversized and are slowing down the time it takes for the page to load.|
|Sign Up|![Sign Up Lighthouse testing](static/images/signup-lighthouse.png)|Similar results to the Index page, page is loading well.|
|Log In|![Log In Lighthouse testing](static/images/login-lighthouse.png)|Similar results to the Index page and Sign up page, page is loading well.|
|Contact|![Contact Page Lighthouse testing](static/images/contact-lighthouse.png)|Similar results to the Index page and Sign up page, page is loading well.|
|Mobile|![Mobile Lighthouse testing](static/images/mobile-lighthouse.png)|This didn't perform as well as the desktop testing, need to review image sizes and loading times to improve the performance.|


### HTML and CSS Validation <!-- omit in toc -->

### HTML 

![HTML Validation](static/images/w3c-html.png)

- All of the HTML pages passed the validator bar a warning on the h1 header. It recomends not to use h1 unless it is a heading, however I believed it looked better aesthetically this way so left it as it is.

### CSS <!-- omit in toc -->

![CSS Validation](static/images/css-validation.png)

- All pages passed the W3C CSS Validation.

# A11y Color Contrast Accessibility Checker

All website pages were tested using the A11y Color Contrast Accessibility Checker and no automated colour contrast issues were found.

# Peer Review

I asked a number of friends both inside and outside of the Code Institute community for feedback on my project. The feedback on the website and documentation was positive.

It was suggested that I could add additional features to the site, which included links to each restaurant and to edit the styling of the log out navbar.


## Known bugs and fixes

- Styling of the Navbar when logged in isn't as good as it should be, need to improve the css for "logout"
- The performance level of the About page needs improving to speed up loading time. This can be fixed at a later date as I did not have time.
- Add extra security in the form of a confirm password on the sign up page.
- Need to fix the styling of the Footer as one icon doesnt render properly.
- Need to change to h1 to pass all w3c html validation checks.
- In future I could render the information submitted in the contact forms straight in to the review boxes on the home page.
